## Covid-19 : IA Machine Learning experiment

(You will find prediction for tomorow & reporting at the end of this README)

With this project i try to predict number of cases & death the day before, for the next day.

This project follow 5 country :
    
    -France
    -China
    -Italy
    -Spain
    -Usa

but we can do this with all country.

Sources of data : https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
i take the full data

## Run experiment

    First launch the notebook 0 , you will have the score of prediction made the day before, and create new dataset to predcict tomorow.
    then run notebook 01.

## Next step :

    -Dockerise the project
    -deploy to azure function set every day at evening, new data are update everyday at 12h30, London hour (i'am European), adapt this to your country.
    -Working on the model


## Some Note's

    -I'am a student in Ml, so i work on the Pipeline, but actualy 29/03, i don't really work on model's, I'm looking for the moment has automated the project, when I am satisfied with this work I will work on the model

## Folders & data :

    All those files are generated by scripts, you dont have to open it.

    Base_Files = full data donwload by the script 01
    pred = Predition made at date (file names contains date)
    rapport = evaluation predcit vs real with error abs.

## Prediction For tomorow 31/03 :
    
    date of prediction will be day -1.

        date	country	        total_cases_predict		total_deaths_predict
    2020-03-30	France	             45016.0		        2891.0
    2020-03-30	China	             82714.0		        3314.0
    2020-03-30	Italy	             103801.0		        11648.0
    2020-03-30	Spain	             84440.0		        7388.0
    2020-03-30	United States	     160815.0		        3233.0



## Reporting : 

    I gather here the synthesis of the error day by day : 
        
    date	country			    error_abs_cases	   error_abs_deaths
    2020-03-29	France		        397.0	             203.0
    2020-03-29	China		        130.0	            -2.0
    2020-03-29	Italy				1033.0	             69.0
    2020-03-29	Spain				2357.0	            -125.0
    2020-03-29	United States		3468.0	             10.0

        date	country			    error_abs_cases	   error_abs_deaths
    2020-03-30	France					2848.0	         109.0
    2020-03-30	China					138.0	        -3.0
    2020-03-30	Italy					1577.0	         314.0
    2020-03-30	Spain					2802.0	         66.0
    2020-03-30	United States			5205.0	         331.0
