## Covid-19 : IA Machine Learning experiment

## Full application for windows user :

    Go on application folder and Just click on the Covid Predictor.exe !
    In the soft, data of the day are display, click on prediction,
    Ia model will display predictions for tomorow. 
    Data are update everyday at 13h/14h -> Central European TimeCET

    Application is in pre-alpha state and work only on windows setup.

## Ia experiment :

(You will find prediction for tomorow & reporting every day at notebook 03 : 
 https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/03-Visu-Over-Time.ipynb)

With this project i try to predict number of cases & death the day before, for the next day.

This project follow 9 country and world state :
    
    -World
    -France
    -China
    -Italy
    -Spain
    -Usa
    -United Kingdom
    -Germany
    -Iran
    -Turkey

but we can do this with all country.

Sources of data : https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
i take the full data.

## Run experiment :
    requirements : Python 3.7, scikit-learn 0.22.1, pycaret 1.0 , then pandas,numpy matplotlib,plotly,seaborn.

    First launch the notebook 0 , you will have the score of prediction made the day before
    and create new dataset to predcict tomorow.
    then run notebook 01 / 02 / 03 
    

## Folders & data :

    All those files are generated by scripts, you dont have to open it. They are on AzureSC folder

    Base_Files = full data donwload by the script 01
    pred = Predition made at date (file names contains date)
    rapport = evaluation predcit vs real with error abs.

## Prediction For tomorow :
    
    At the end of notebook : https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/01-Ts-Predict-Covid.ipynb
    or in the pred folder in azureSC.

## Reporting : 

    Follow daily reporting on the notebook 03 : https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/03-Visu-Over-Time.ipynb

## Some Note's

     I'm looking for the moment has automated the project, when I am satisfied with this work 
     I will add features to the app.
