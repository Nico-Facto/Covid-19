Project is no longer maintained

## Full application :

https://covpredic.herokuapp.com/

Data are update everyday at 13h/14h -> Central European TimeCET

This repo only contains the code to follow the backend pipline of the app.
It executes the code locally from the notebooks and creates the csv necessary for the operation of the app on the server side. 
The code that orchestrates everything is not provided.
See details in Run experiment and Folders & data section of this readme

## Ia experiment :

(You will find prediction for tomorow & reporting every day at notebook 03 : 
 https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/03-Visu-Over-Time.ipynb)

With this project i try to predict number of cases & death the day before, for the next day.

Notebook's follow 10 country and world state :
    
    -World
    -France
    -China
    -Italy
    -Spain

    -Iran
    -Turkey
    -Brazil

but we can do this with all country.

Sources of data : https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
i take the full data.

## Run experiment :
    requirements : Python 3.7, scikit-learn 0.23.2, then pandas,numpy matplotlib,plotly,seaborn.

    !!! First time ignore the notebook 0 !!!!

    First launch the notebook 0 , you will have the score of prediction made the day before
    and create new dataset to predcict tomorow.
    then run notebook 01 / 02 / 03 

## Folders & data :

    All those files are generated by scripts, you dont have to open it. They are on data folder

    Base_Files = full data donwload by the script 01
    pred = Predition made at date (file names contains date)
    rapport = evaluation predict vs real with error abs.

## Prediction For tomorow :
    
    At the end of notebook : https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/01-Ts-Predict-Covid.ipynb
    or in the pred folder in azureSC.

## Reporting : 

    Follow daily reporting on the notebook 03 : https://github.com/Nico-Facto/Covid-19/blob/master/03-Visu-Over-Time.ipynb
